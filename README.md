# Bike Sharing Analysis - Dicoding Final Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike sharing trends, examining the impact of various factors such as weather and seasonality on rental patterns. The analysis was conducted in **Google Colab**, and a **Streamlit** dashboard was created to visualize the results.

## Environment

- **Development Environment:** Google Colab
- **Dashboard Deployment:** Streamlit
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

## Setting Up the Environment

### 1. Install Required Libraries

If you're running the code locally, you'll need to install the necessary libraries first. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

### 2. Cloning the Repository

Make sure the code and datasets are available by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azzahangely/bike-sharing.git
```

### Running the Streamlit App

Once your clone is set up, you can run the Streamlit dashboard to visualize the analysis i have made. From your terminal, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run Dashboard/dashboard_bike-sharing-analysis.py
```

This will launch a local Streamlit server where you can explore the visualizations and insights from the analysis in a user-friendly dashboard.

#### Dashboard Features

- Data Overview: Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
- Visualization: Shows trends, patterns, and correlations in bike rental data.
- Interactive Filtering: Allows users to filter data by dataset available.
